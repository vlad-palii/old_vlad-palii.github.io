                    <p>
                        When I started to work here, the current huge medical project was in a battered condition. Completely bad codebase without any comments, without design or requirement documentation, without access to previous developers. Nothing. But I've coped with it. Now a huge part of application redesigned,  and a lot of legacy code fixed. Not from scratch, step by step, all fixed. UI interface renewed. Added unit testing, and linked with CircleCI environment. And the customer is happy!

                        I've been involved in designing full vision and main idea of this project, and developing a lot of things, like UX features and UI parts of application.
                        <br><br>
                        I'm proud that i was responsible for all process of design from zero to ready for use product. Choosing key technologies, and methodologies, it was really cool to think about all parts of future of this project - about future users, and benefits from application.
                        <br><br>
                        Conclusion:
                        I've learned a lot about how make something great from zero to ready for use product, about self-education and self-development of dev skills, to making my best on this work.
                        <br><br>
                        The main thing what i found out on this position, it's self-organization, when business gives you time and money, you should know how rightly spend these resources.
